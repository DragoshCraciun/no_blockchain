Concept | Description | Extras
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Proof of work | All miners compete with each other to find the random nonce value that satisfies <br>the specific function in order to write the next block. The first to find it <br>will receive a reword from the block that has just been created. |
<!-- Proof of stake | All miners decide how much of their cryptocurrency do they want to put at stake <br>and then they try to find the hash for the next block. When the hash for the next <br>block is found the miner that had put at stake the most will receive the reward. |-->
